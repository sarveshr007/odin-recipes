    <p>Pani Puri, also known as golgappa or puchka, is a beloved Indian street food that’s a burst of flavors in every bite. It consists of small, crispy, hollow puris filled with a spicy potato mixture, tangy tamarind chutney, and a zesty, spiced water (pani). The combination of sweet, sour, spicy, and savory makes it an irresistible snack. It’s my absolute favorite because each puri delivers a delightful explosion of taste, bringing back memories of enjoying it at bustling street stalls with friends.</p>
